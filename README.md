- Mobile-first workflow

- Addtional breakpoints to maintain flow

### What I learned

I am progressing in regards to effeciency. This project took me roughly eight hours. My last project (podcast-landing paage) was completed in about seventeen. For this particular project, I was able to practice using postioning while applying z-index for the main desktop image. I was wondering why the header button was not able to show hover or active effects, and it turned out that the transparent part of the main image was overlapping. 

I also spent more time learning about the figma design and how to pull needed information.
